# Peer Review

**Project Reviewed: [classification_NathanSloss.ipynb](https://github.com/nwn8/applied-ml-nates/blob/main/notebooks/Midterm/classification_NathanSloss.ipynb)**


1. Clarity & Organization

The notebook is well-structured and easy to follow. Each step is labeled clearly.
Suggestion: Add short notes before code blocks and maybe a summary table at the end for quick reference.

2. Feature Selection & Justification

The chosen features make sense for the goal, and preprocessing steps are explained.
Suggestion: Add a short note on why certain features were selected or left out and maybe show feature importance.

3. Model Performance & Comparisons

Model performance is reported clearly with accuracy and confusion matrix.
Suggestion: A simple table comparing different models would make results easier to understand.

4. Reflection Quality

Reflections show good understanding of the process.
Suggestion: Include a few numbers (like accuracy changes) or next steps for improvement.

Overall:
A clear and well-done project! Small additions like summaries, visuals, and comparisons would make it even stronger.
